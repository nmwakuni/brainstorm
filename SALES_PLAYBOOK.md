**Subject**: Re: Quick question about employee turnover at [Company]

```
Hi [First Name],

Following up on my email from [Day]. I know you're busy, so I'll keep this short.

Many HR managers tell us salary advances are their biggest headache:
❌ Employees asking constantly
❌ Tracking who owes what
❌ Fraud and "ghosts"
❌ HR spending hours on admin

We solve all of this. Employees get advances in 60 seconds via their phone.
You get your time back.

Worth a quick 15-min call?

### Email #3: Value Bomb (Day 7)

**Subject**: [First Name], here's what this costs you

```
Hi [First Name],

Still on my mind: employee turnover at [Company].

Here's what it's costing you right now:

With [X] employees at ~KES [Y] monthly salary:
• Turnover (30%/year): ~KES 3M in hiring/training costs
• HR time on advances: ~KES 40K/month
• Advance fraud: ~KES 100K/month

Total: KES 3.5M+ annually

Our platform costs KES 30K/month = KES 360K/year.

You save: KES 3.2M+ annually (9x ROI)

Can I show you how in 15 minutes?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - Including a quick case study from a similar company.

**Show mobile app**:

"This is what your employees see.

Let me walk through requesting an advance:

[Demo mobile app]

1. Login with fingerprint (or PIN)
2. See available balance - this auto-calculates based on days worked
3. Enter amount - can't exceed their earned amount
4. See the fee upfront (4%, way less than alternatives)
5. Confirm

That's it. No calling HR. No paperwork. No waiting.

Questions so far?"
```

**Key points**:

Let me show you uploading employees:

### 4. ROI (5 min)

**Show calculator**:

```
"Let me show you the numbers for [Company].

[Share ROI spreadsheet]

Current costs:
- Turnover (30%/year): ~[X] employees to replace @ KES 100K each = KES [Y]
- HR time: [Z] hours/month @ KES 2K/hour = KES [A]
- Fraud/non-repayment: ~2% of payroll = KES [B]

Total: KES [X+A+B] per year

Our cost:
- Platform: KES 30K/month = KES 360K/year
- Transaction fees: ~KES 20K/month = KES 240K/year
(Employees pay this, but let's count it)

Total: KES 600K/year

Net savings: KES [X+A+B-600K] per year

ROI: [X] times return

Plus: Happier employees, modern employer brand, better recruitment.

Make sense?"
```

### 5. Next Steps (3 min)

**Pilot proposal**:

```
"So here's what I recommend:

Let's do a 3-month free pilot with [X] employees.

Timeline:
- Week 1: Upload your roster, configure settings
- Week 2: Employee training session (30 min, we run it)
- Week 3-12: Live, we monitor daily
- Week 12: Review results, decide if you want to continue

If it works, you save [X]. If not, you've risked nothing.

Sound fair?

[Pause for answer]

Great! I'll send over the pilot agreement today.
Can you do me a favor and send your employee roster
(just names, IDs, salaries, M-Pesa numbers)?

We can go live next week."
```

## 🤝 Handling Objections

### "The fee is too high for employees"

**Response**:
```
"I hear you. Let me put it in perspective:

Alternatives your employees use now:
- Loan sharks: 20-30% for short-term
- Tala/Branch: 12-18%
- Bank overdraft: 10% + fees

We're 4%. And for loyal users, it drops to 3%.

Plus, they get money in 60 seconds. No credit check. No paperwork.

What if we waive the fee for the first 50 employees as part
of the pilot? Let them try it risk-free."
```

---

### "We can't afford it right now"

**Response**:
```
"I totally understand budget concerns.

But consider this: You're already paying for this problem.

Turnover alone costs you [X] per year. We cost [Y] per year.

You save [X-Y].

Also, the pilot is free. Zero cost for 3 months.
You only pay if you see results.

Can you afford NOT to try it?"
```

---

### "Employees won't use a new app"

**Response**:
```
"Great point. Adoption is everything.

That's why we:
1. Run onboarding sessions at your office
2. Have in-app tutorials
3. Offer WhatsApp support in English & Swahili
4. Make the first advance free (to drive trial)

Also, it's M-Pesa. Every Kenyan knows M-Pesa.
The app just makes it easier.

In our pilots, we see 70% adoption in the first month.
Want to see testimonials from employees?"
```

---

### "We need to think about it"

**Response**:
```
"Of course, big decisions need thought.

Can I ask: What specifically do you need to think about?

[Listen]

Got it. Here's what I'll do:
- Send you case studies from [similar industry]
- Send ROI calculator customized for [Company]
- Send references from current customers

Can we reconnect in [3-5 days] to discuss?

Also, just so you know: We're only taking on 10 pilot
customers this quarter. We have 3 spots left.

Not trying to pressure you, just want to be transparent."
```

---

### "We already have a process that works"

**Response**:
```
"I'm glad you have a process. That puts you ahead of most.

Can I ask: What does your process cost?

[Listen]

Here's what we typically find:

Manual processes cost:
- HR time: [X] hours/month
- Tracking errors
- Fraud (2-3% of payroll)
- Delayed repayments

Our customers save 80-90% of these costs.

Plus: Employees get faster access, which drives satisfaction.

Worth comparing the numbers side by side?"

2. **You're helping**: You're solving a real problem.
3. **Speed wins**: Fast follow-up beats perfect follow-up.
4. **Ask for the sale**: Don't be shy. "Ready to start the pilot?"
5. **Learn from every call**: What worked? What didn't?

### Motivation
- Every "yes" = KES 30K MRR = KES 360K ARR
- 3 deals/month = KES 1M+ ARR
- 12 months = profitable business
- 24 months = life-changing exit

**You got this! Now go sell! 🚀**
